# Turing Machine Simulator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulator for deterministic Turing machines, designed for an educational purpose as part of a midterm assessment. The simulator validates Turing machine configurations, runs simulations on specified input strings, and outputs configuration files based on class-defined formats.

## Features
- Load Turing machine specifications from a text file.
- Validate Turing machine components as per specifications.
- Simulate the Turing machine, with support for:
  - Acceptance state
  - Rejection state
  - Infinite loops for specific inputs
- Output configurations to a text file.
